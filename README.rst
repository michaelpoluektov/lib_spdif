Summary
*******

S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) is a standard for transmitting digital audio signals over
relatively short distances between devices. It was developed by Sony and Philips and is used to
carry high-quality digital audio without the need for analog conversion, maintaining the integrity
of the audio signal.

S/PDIF can carry two channels of uncompressed PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) audio or over Optical
(TOSLINK) or Coaxial transmission mediums.

``lib_spdif`` provides software defined S/PDIF implementation that allows transmission and reception
of S/PDIF data via `xcore` ports.
